# sermonNotes2022
 
Hello!  Herein are the notes that I took during the sermons preached at True
Way Presbyterian Church.  The notes are found in the .pdf document, which is
produced using LaTeX, whereas the source files used to produce the document
are found in the folders labelled by the month.  To fellow church members,
feel free to issue pull requests if you want to contribute to these set of
notes (i.e, if you feel like I have missed out anything).  To non-church
members, this is a only a taste of what the sermons in TWPC are like (it is
impossible to capture everything said during the sermon).  Feel free to visit
and attend our services to hear the sermons for yourself.
