# Sermon-Notes
 
Hello!  Herein are the notes that I took during the sermons preached at True
Way Presbyterian Church.  To access the notes, just click on the `.pdf`
documents labelled by the year, e.g "sermonNotes2022.pdf".  These `.pdf`
documents are produced using LaTeX, whereas the source files used to produce
the document are found in the folders labelled by the year and then the
month.

To fellow church members, feel free to issue pull requests if you want to
contribute to these set of notes (i.e, if you feel like I have missed out
anything).

To non-church members, this is a only a taste of what the sermons in TWPC are
like (it is impossible to capture everything said during the sermon).  Feel
free to visit and attend our services to hear the sermons for yourself.
