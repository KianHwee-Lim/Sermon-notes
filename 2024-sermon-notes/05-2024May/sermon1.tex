\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Todayâ€™s text has many exhortations, one after another, in rapid fire
  \item One possible overarching theme for all of the exhortations is humility, c.f v6 and v10. All the other exhortations are related to that.
  \item V10 tells us to humble ourselves before the Lord. When we do so, four things should happen:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item We will relinquish control (7a)
      \item We will resist the devil (7b)
      \item We will return to God (8a)
      \item We will repent from sin (8b)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
